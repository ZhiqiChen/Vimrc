		() cature group use \1, \2 in subs :%s/\(\w\) and/\1 but not/g

	:g or :10,+5g (line 10 to 15). :g/./s/pattern/replace/g get and execute command
		:g/1 2/p print out all lines with (1 2)

Macros:
	q(letter) to start recording a macro to the letter
		then do a bunch of things you want to record
		end it in command mode by pressing q again
		This will save the commands in to @(Capital Letter)

		by pressing @(capital letter) you can do the macro
		combining it with #@(capital letter) ie. 20@W you can repeat the macro 20 times

Auto completion: (^means ctrl)

		use marks for local (ie. :'a, 'bs/[substitute]/[another]/gc
        *try to use capital letter for global nav.
	`[letter] to go to that mark
	`` return to previous location of a movment ie. G, gg, search
	ctrl-^ return to previous buffer

Advanced commands:
    :norm runs a normal command ie. :norm I<br>
    :! runs a bash command
    :read to read the output from other commands
    	:read !ls    will read all of the filenames

	cs") change surround quotes into brackets
	cst<em> change surround tag into <em>

it is useful for deletion to use a instead of i.
